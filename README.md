## Project Overview

This mobile website tutorial demonstrates how to build a responsive site optimized for mobile devices. The project includes basic HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive features. It provides a foundation that can be expanded upon for more complex projects.

## Features

- Responsive design that adapts to various mobile devices
- Basic interactive elements using JavaScript
- Clean and simple design using CSS

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the mobile website project.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A text editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mobile-website-tutorial.git
   cd mobile-website-tutorial
   ```

2. **Open the project:**

   Open the `index.html` file in your preferred text editor or IDE.

## Usage

### Viewing on Mobile

1. **Open the `index.html` file:**

   Open `index.html` in your web browser. You can drag and drop the file into your browser or use a local server to view it.

2. **Test on a mobile device:**

   To see how the site looks on mobile devices, you can use your browser's developer tools to simulate different mobile screen sizes. In Chrome, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+M` (or `Cmd+Shift+M` on Mac) to toggle device mode.

### Basic Features

- **Responsive Layout:** The website layout adapts to various screen sizes using CSS media queries.
- **Interactive Elements:** Basic JavaScript functions are included to handle user interactions.

## Customization

You can customize the mobile website by modifying the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file where you can add or modify content.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the website. Adjust the styles to fit your design needs.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactive features. Add or modify functions to enhance interactivity.

### Example Customizations

- **Change Background Color:** Edit the `body` selector in `styles.css` to change the background color.

  ```css
  body {
      background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Change this color as needed */
  }
  ```

- **Add a Button Action:** Modify `script.js` to add new JavaScript functions.

  ```javascript
  document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
      alert('Button clicked!');
  });
  ```
